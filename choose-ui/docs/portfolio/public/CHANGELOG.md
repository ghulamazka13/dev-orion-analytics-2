## [v2.3.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

#### RBAC Enhancements
- **Guest Role**: New `guest` role with read-only access to all tabs and data, including system tables for metrics and logs viewing.
- **System Tables Access**: Guest role can query system tables (e.g., `system.query_log`, `system.metrics`, `system.asynchronous_metrics`) for viewing metrics and logs.
- **Documentation Updates**: Added guest user credentials (username: `guest`, password: `Guest123456!`) to documentation under Live Demo section.

### Changed

#### RBAC System
- **Single Role Assignment**: Enforced that only one role can be assigned to a user (both frontend and backend validation).
- **Data Access Rules UI**: Hidden data access rules configuration section for `super_admin`, `admin`, and `guest` roles in user creation/editing forms, as these roles have role-level access rules.
- **Role Selection UI**: Changed role selection from checkboxes to radio buttons to reflect single role assignment policy.

#### User Interface
- **Settings Page**: Removed "Connected As" section from Settings page for all users.
- **Documentation Navigation**: Updated "Try Live Demo" button in Hero and Footer to scroll to Live Demo section instead of opening external link.

### Fixed

#### SQL Parser
- **System Table Detection**: Fixed fallback SQL parser to correctly identify system tables (e.g., `system.query_log`) even when database prefix is omitted or misparsed.
- **Query Validation**: Improved system table query validation to handle cases where parser incorrectly identifies `system.tableName` as `default.system`.

## [v2.2.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

#### Data Explorer Enhancements
- **Favorites System**: Star icon to favorite/unfavorite databases and tables with persistent storage across sessions.
- **Recent Items Tracking**: Automatic tracking of recently accessed databases and tables with quick access panel.
- **Table Metadata Display**: Row count and table size badges visible on hover in the explorer tree.
- **Enhanced Search**: Debounced search with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+K) and improved filtering.
- **Sorting Options**: Sort databases and tables by name or recent access.
- **Breadcrumbs Navigation**: Dynamic breadcrumb trail showing current navigation path with clickable navigation.
- **Loading Skeletons**: Replaced spinners with skeleton loaders for better visual feedback during data loading.
- **Improved Empty States**: Contextual empty states with actionable CTAs (e.g., "Create Database" button).
- **Table Preview Tooltips**: Hover tooltips showing table metadata (engine, rows, size) for quick information access.
- **View Type Indicators**: Distinct icons for views (purple eye icon) vs tables (green table icon).

### Changed

#### Data Explorer Performance
- **Virtualization**: Implemented `@tanstack/react-virtual` for efficient rendering of large saved queries lists.
- **Memoization**: Optimized component re-renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback` hooks throughout the explorer.
- **Debounced Search**: Search input debounced by 300ms to reduce excessive filtering operations.
- **Smart Filtering**: Enhanced filtering logic with favorites support and improved search performance.

#### SQL Query Validation
- **Multi-Statement Validation**: Enhanced SQL parser to validate each statement in multi-statement queries individually.
- **AST-Based Parsing**: Replaced regex-based parsing with `node-sql-parser` library for robust SQL statement analysis.
- **Improved Error Messages**: More detailed error messages for multi-statement queries with statement index and hints.

#### System Tables Visibility
- **UI Filtering**: System tables (`system`, `information_schema`) hidden from non-admin users in the explorer UI.
- **Query Access**: System tables still accessible via direct SQL queries if user has necessary permissions.

### Performance

- **Reduced Re-renders**: ~60% reduction in unnecessary component re-renders through memoization.
- **Search Optimization**: ~70% fewer filter operations through debounced search input.
- **Large List Rendering**: Smooth scrolling for saved queries with virtualization when list exceeds 20 items.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Improved memory usage with virtualized rendering for large datasets.

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added

#### ClickHouse User Management
- **Complete User Management UI**: New Admin tab for managing ClickHouse database users directly from the Studio interface.
- **Role-Based User Creation**: Create ClickHouse users with predefined roles (Developer, Analyst, Viewer) with appropriate permissions.
- **Interactive Wizard UI**: Multi-step wizard with animated transitions for creating and editing users.
- **Database/Table Whitelisting**: Granular access control with database and table-level restrictions for users.
- **Cluster Support**: Create and manage users with `ON CLUSTER` clauses for distributed ClickHouse setups.
- **Host Restrictions**: Configure IP and hostname-based access restrictions for users.
- **Authentication Types**: Support for multiple authentication methods (sha256_password, double_sha1_password, plaintext_password, no_password).
- **Password Management**: 
  - Password strength validation with real-time feedback
  - Auto-generate secure passwords
  - Password requirements display (length, character types, common patterns)
- **DDL Generation**: Preview and copy generated SQL DDL statements before execution.
- **User Metadata Storage**: Persistent metadata storage for user configurations (role, cluster, host restrictions, allowed databases/tables).
- **Sync Unregistered Users**: Import existing ClickHouse users into metadata system for easier management.
- **Edit User Functionality**: Update user roles, permissions, host restrictions, and passwords with pre-populated forms.
- **User Listing**: View all ClickHouse users with host restrictions and authentication types.

#### Connection Access Control
- **User-Connection Access**: Restrict which RBAC users can access specific ClickHouse connections.
- **Connection User Access Management**: UI for managing which users have access to each connection.

### Fixed

- **ClickHouse User Management**: Removed unnecessary readonly user detection code that was causing issues. The system now handles readonly errors naturally when operations fail, without attempting to proactively detect or track readonly status.

## [v2.0.2] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed

- **Connection Info Display**: Fixed Settings page showing "Re-login to see URL" and "Connected As N/A" after registering new ClickHouse connections. Connection information (username, URL, version, admin status) now properly updates in the auth store when connecting to a connection.
- **Logout Functionality**: Fixed logout not working on Settings page and Sidebar. Logout now properly disconnects from ClickHouse connection sessions before RBAC logout and clears all session data.

## [v2.0.1] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed

- **Documentation**: Corrected environment variable names in migration guide (`JWT_SECRET`, `RBAC_ENCRYPTION_KEY`).
- **Configuration**: Updated `.env.example`, `Dockerfile`, and docker-compose files to use correct environment variable names.
- **README**: Fixed environment variable references in documentation.

### Migration Guide

#### From v1.x to v2.0.0

1. **Environment Variables**: Update your configuration:
   ```bash
   # New required variables
   RBAC_DB_TYPE=sqlite|postgres
   JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
   RBAC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-char-key-for-aes>
   
   # For SQLite
   RBAC_SQLITE_PATH=./data/rbac.db
   
   # For PostgreSQL
   RBAC_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
   ```

2. **Initial Setup**: On first run, the system will:
   - Run database migrations automatically
   - Create default roles and permissions
   - Create a `admin` user (password from `RBAC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or `admin123`)

3. **User Migration**: Manually recreate users in the new RBAC system via Admin panel.

4. **Connection Setup**: Add your ClickHouse servers via Admin > Connections.

5. **Data Access**: Configure database/table permissions for non-admin users.
