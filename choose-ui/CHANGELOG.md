## [v2.7.4] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **Automatic Database Creation**: Added automatic database creation for PostgreSQL and SQLite metadata databases:
  - **SQLite**: Automatically creates the database directory and file if they don't exist
  - **PostgreSQL**: Automatically creates the database if it doesn't exist (requires `CREATEDB` privilege)
  - Eliminates the need for manual database setup during initial configuration
  - Graceful error handling with informative logging

- **Comprehensive Permission-Based UI Hiding**: All UI elements are now hidden based on user permissions:
  - **Metrics Page**: Advanced tabs (Performance, Storage, Merges, Errors) are hidden for users with only `METRICS_VIEW` permission
  - **Home/Overview Page**: Quick Actions section hides actions based on permissions (Explorer, Metrics, Logs, Admin)
  - **Explorer Page**: Database/table operation dropdowns show only actions user has permission for:
    - "New Database" requires `DB_CREATE`
    - "New Table" requires `TABLE_CREATE`
    - "Upload File" requires `TABLE_INSERT`
  - **Logs Page**: User/role filter dropdowns now check `QUERY_HISTORY_VIEW_ALL` permission (not just super admin)
  - **Saved Queries**: All saved query features are permission-gated:
    - DataExplorer "Queries" tab requires `SAVED_QUERIES_VIEW`
    - HomeTab saved queries section requires `SAVED_QUERIES_VIEW`
    - SqlEditor save button requires `SAVED_QUERIES_CREATE` or `SAVED_QUERIES_UPDATE`
  - Users can only see and access features they have permission for, improving security and UX

### Documentation

- Added PostgreSQL permission requirements to README with SQL examples for granting `CREATEDB` privilege
- Added troubleshooting entry for PostgreSQL permission issues

## [v2.7.3] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **RBAC Permission Checks for All Pages**: Added proper RBAC permission checks for all application pages:
  - **Overview/Home Page**: Now requires admin role (consistent with sidebar visibility)
  - **Logs Page**: Requires `QUERY_HISTORY_VIEW` or `QUERY_HISTORY_VIEW_ALL` permission
  - **Explorer Page**: Requires `DB_VIEW` or `TABLE_VIEW` permission
  - **Settings Page**: Requires `SETTINGS_VIEW` permission
  - All pages now properly enforce RBAC permissions, redirecting unauthorized users appropriately

- **Role Form Dialog Enhancements**: Added Collapse/Expand All button in role creation/editing dialog:
  - Single toggle button that switches between "Expand All" and "Collapse All" based on current state
  - Makes it easier to navigate permission categories when managing roles
  - Button shows appropriate icon (ChevronsDown/ChevronsUp) based on state

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Icon in Alert**: Fixed duplicate AlertCircle icon in "At least one permission is required" alert message. The Alert component already includes an icon based on variant, so the manual icon was removed.

## [v2.7.2] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed

- **Super Admin System Role Modification**: Fixed bug where super admins were blocked from modifying system roles despite having the proper permissions. The service layer now respects the route-level permission check, allowing super admins to modify system roles (including the super_admin role itself). (Fixes #50)
- **GitHub Pages SPA Routing for Googlebot**: Fixed redirect errors for Googlebot smartphone crawler by adding automatic `404.html` file generation during build. GitHub Pages now properly serves the SPA for all routes, ensuring proper indexing without redirect errors. (Fixes Google Search Console redirect errors)

## [v2.7.1] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed

- **Role Permissions in Edit Mode**: Fixed bug where previously selected permissions were missing when editing a role. The issue was caused by a mismatch between permission names (returned by backend) and permission IDs (expected by frontend). Now correctly maps permission names to IDs when initializing the edit form. (Fixes #46)
- **Explorer Dropdown Menu Actions**: Fixed two related bugs in the Explorer page dropdown menu:
  - Clicking "New Query" no longer triggers "View Details" action. Added proper event propagation handling to prevent unintended side effects.
  - Clicking disabled menu items (due to missing permissions) no longer opens the info tab. Disabled items now properly prevent event propagation. (Fixes #47)

## [v2.7.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

#### Role Management UI
- **Interactive Role Creation/Editing**: New beautiful UI dialog for creating and editing RBAC roles
  - Create custom roles with custom permissions
  - Edit custom roles (name, display name, description, permissions, default flag)
  - Edit predefined/system roles (display name, description, permissions - backend enforces system role protection)
  - Permission selection by category with search functionality
  - Select All/Deselect All permissions
  - Collapsible permission categories with visual feedback
  - Smooth animations using Framer Motion
  - Default role assignment with automatic flag management

### Fixed

- **Default Role Flag**: Fixed bug where assigning a custom role as default didn't remove the default flag from the previous default role. Now ensures only one role can be default at any given time with atomic operations.

### Changed

#### Legacy Authentication Removal
- **RBAC-Only Authentication**: Removed all legacy ClickHouse session-based authentication code
  - Deleted `packages/server/src/routes/auth.ts` (legacy auth routes)
  - Deleted `src/api/auth.ts` (legacy auth API client)
  - Deleted `packages/server/src/middleware/auth.ts` (legacy auth middleware)
  - All authentication now strictly uses RBAC, improving security and simplifying the codebase

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Consistent Button Styling**: All buttons in Admin page now use consistent styling (`variant="outline"` with unified className)
- **Dialog Layout Improvements**: Fixed padding and scrolling issues in all dialogs
  - Proper flexbox layout for scrollable content
  - Consistent padding structure (`px-6` for horizontal, `py-4`/`py-6` for vertical)
  - Fixed height dialogs (`h-[90vh]`) with proper overflow handling
- **Enhanced Visual Design**: Improved animations and visual hierarchy across role management components

### Removed

- **Legacy Authentication Code**: Complete removal of unused ClickHouse session-based authentication
  - Legacy auth routes, API client, and middleware removed
  - All routes now require RBAC authentication only

### Security

- **Strengthened Authentication**: Removal of legacy auth paths reduces attack surface
- **RBAC Enforcement**: All routes now strictly require RBAC authentication

### Code Quality

- **Console Logging**: All debug console.log statements in ClickHouseUsers component are now wrapped in `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` checks
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed against `.rules/CODE_CHANGES.md` and `.rules/CODE_REVIEWER.md`

## [v2.6.1] - 2026-01-16

### Security

#### Critical Security Fixes
- **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (Issue #27)**: Fixed multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities across the codebase
  - Added SQL identifier validation and escaping utilities (`validateIdentifier`, `escapeIdentifier`, `escapeQualifiedIdentifier`)
  - Implemented column type validation against whitelist
  - Fixed SQL injection in file upload, database/table routes, ALTER TABLE operations, and query hooks
  - All user-provided identifiers (database, table, column names) are now validated and properly escaped before use in SQL queries

- **XSS Vulnerabilities (Issue #28)**: Fixed cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
  - Integrated DOMPurify for HTML sanitization across all components using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  - Fixed XSS in `AgTable`, `SqlTab`, `ManualCreationForm`, and `ConfirmationDialog` components
  - Added security warnings about localStorage token storage risks
  - All HTML content is now sanitized before rendering to prevent script injection

- **Weak Encryption and Environment Validation (Issue #29)**: Strengthened encryption and added production validation
  - Replaced weak `scryptSync` with proper PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
  - Removed hardcoded salt - now requires `RBAC_ENCRYPTION_SALT` environment variable in production
  - Removed default JWT secret - now requires `JWT_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters) in production
  - Added startup validation that fails fast if required environment variables are missing
  - Fixed silent decryption failures to throw errors instead of logging and returning null

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **Production Environment Variables**: The following environment variables are now **required** in production:
  - `JWT_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters, recommended 64+)
  - `RBAC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (minimum 32 characters, recommended 64 hex characters)
  - `RBAC_ENCRYPTION_SALT` (exactly 64 hex characters)
  - Server will **fail to start** in production if these are not set, preventing deployment with weak defaults

#### Migration Notes
- Existing encrypted passwords may need to be re-encrypted if the encryption key changes
- All SQL identifiers are now validated and escaped, which may reject previously accepted invalid names
- HTML content is now sanitized, which may affect custom formatting in some edge cases

## [v2.6.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

#### Saved Queries Migration to RBAC Database
- **RBAC-Based Storage**: Migrated saved queries from ClickHouse to RBAC metadata database (`rbac_saved_queries` table). Queries are now properly scoped by user with optional connection association.

- **Connection-Aware Filtering**: Filter Pinned, Recent, and Saved Queries by connection (current, all, or specific).
- **Polished Empty States**: Contextual empty states with helpful descriptions for each tab.
- **Animated Transitions**: Smooth tab transitions with Framer Motion.

### Changed

#### Database Schema
- **Saved Queries Table**: New `rbac_saved_queries` table with `userId`, `connectionId`, `connectionName`, `name`, `query`, `description`, `isPublic`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` columns.
- **User Favorites/Recent Items**: Extended `rbac_user_favorites` and `rbac_user_recent_items` tables with `connectionId` and `connectionName` columns for connection-aware tracking.
- **Migrations**: Added v1.4.0, v1.5.0, v1.6.0 migrations for schema changes with proper `ON DELETE SET NULL` handling.

#### API Changes
- **Saved Queries Routes**: Refactored to use RBAC database instead of ClickHouse. Removed `/status`, `/activate`, `/deactivate` endpoints.
- **User Preferences Routes**: Extended favorites and recent items APIs to accept `connectionId` and `connectionName`.

- **Reactive Favorites**: Pinned star now updates immediately without requiring page refresh.
- **Non-Clickable Title**: SQL editor title is now display-only; renaming available through dropdown menu.
- **Removed Pencil Icon**: Removed edit icon from SQL editor for cleaner interface.

### Fixed

- **Pinned Star Not Updating**: Fixed `TreeNode` component to subscribe directly to favorites array for reactive re-rendering.
- **Rename and Save Not Working**: Fixed `updateSavedQuery` to properly pass name parameter and invalidate query cache.
- **Saved Queries Not Refreshing**: Added proper React Query cache invalidation after save/update operations.
- **Count Display Issues**: Fixed messy count badges in Explorer tabs by using proper `tabular-nums` styling.
- **Color Inconsistency**: Removed custom gradients and aligned hover/background colors across Explorer page.
- **Connection Filter Scope**: Filter now correctly applies only to Pinned, Recent, and Queries tabs (not Databases, which is connection-specific).

### Removed

- **ActivateSavedQueries Component**: Removed admin component for enabling/disabling ClickHouse-based saved queries (feature now always available via RBAC).
- **ClickHouse Saved Queries**: Removed all ClickHouse-specific saved queries logic from `ClickHouseService`.
- **Legacy Status Checks**: Removed `useSavedQueriesStatus`, `useActivateSavedQueries`, `useDeactivateSavedQueries` hooks.

### Security

- **Ownership Validation**: Saved queries can only be updated/deleted by their owner (validated server-side).
- **User Scoping**: Queries are properly scoped by `userId` with optional public sharing.

- **Explorer Auto-Refresh**: Fixed Explorer tab not automatically refreshing when connection changes. Explorer now listens to connection change events and automatically fetches databases and tables from the newly selected connection.
- **Database Creation with ON CLUSTER**: Fixed database creation to properly support `ON CLUSTER` statements for distributed ClickHouse setups. Removed incorrect condition that prevented cluster creation from working.

### Security

- **Hono Framework**: Upgraded Hono from 4.11.3 to 4.11.4 to address security vulnerability.

### Added

- **Database Cluster Support**: Added cluster selection UI to database creation dialog, matching table creation functionality. Users can now create databases on distributed ClickHouse clusters through the UI.

#### RBAC System
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Complete RBAC implementation for authentication and authorization.
- **Predefined Roles**: `super_admin`, `admin`, `developer`, `analyst`, `viewer` with granular permissions.
- **Permission Categories**: User Management, Role Management, Database Operations, Table Operations, Query Operations, Saved Queries, Metrics, Settings, Audit.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with access and refresh tokens.
- **Argon2 Password Hashing**: Industry-standard password security.

#### Database Support
- **Dual Database Backend**: Support for both SQLite (development/single-node) and PostgreSQL (production/scalable).
- **Version-Based Migrations**: Automatic schema migrations with version tracking.
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for RBAC database management (`rbac:status`, `rbac:migrate`, `rbac:seed`, `rbac:reset`).

#### ClickHouse Connection Management
- **Multi-Server Support**: Connect to multiple ClickHouse servers from a single Studio instance.
- **Connection CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete ClickHouse connections via Admin UI.
- **Secure Password Storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption for stored connection passwords.
- **Connection Testing**: Test connectivity before saving connections.
- **Connection Selector**: Sidebar dropdown to switch between ClickHouse servers.
- **Session Persistence**: Selected connection persists across browser reloads.

#### Data Access Rules
- **Granular Permissions**: Define database/table access rules per user.
- **Pattern Matching**: Support for wildcards (e.g., `analytics_*`, `*_staging`).
- **Access Type Inheritance**: Access levels (read/write/admin) derived from role permissions.
- **Query Validation**: SQL queries validated against access rules before execution.
- **Explorer Filtering**: Database/table tree filtered based on user permissions.
- **System Table Access**: Essential system tables always accessible for metadata queries.

#### Security
- **CORS Protection**: Strict origin enforcement in production mode.
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, clickjacking prevention, CSP headers.
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of user actions and security events.
- **API Protection**: All endpoints protected by JWT and permission middleware.

#### Deployment
- **Production Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with security hardening.
- **Docker Compose (SQLite)**: Simple deployment for development/small teams.
- **Docker Compose (PostgreSQL)**: Production-ready deployment with PostgreSQL RBAC backend.
- **Environment Configuration**: Comprehensive environment variable support.

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Authentication now requires RBAC login instead of direct ClickHouse credentials.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: User management moved from ClickHouse DDL to Studio RBAC system.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Environment variables restructured for RBAC configuration.
- **Admin Panel**: Refactored with new tabs for Users, Roles, Connections, and Audit Logs.
- **Login Page**: Redesigned for RBAC authentication with glassmorphism UI.
- **Sidebar**: Added connection selector and permission-aware navigation.
- **README**: Complete rewrite with architecture diagrams, deployment guides, and security documentation.

### Deprecated

- `CLICKHOUSE_DEFAULT_URL`: Use RBAC connections instead.
- `CLICKHOUSE_PRESET_URLS`: Use RBAC connections instead.
- `CLICKHOUSE_DEFAULT_USER`: Use RBAC connections instead.

### Removed

- Direct ClickHouse user management via DDL statements.
- Legacy authentication flow without RBAC.
- Unused components: `RbacUsersTable`, `RbacUserForm`, `RbacLogin`, `DataAccessRules` (role-level).

### Security

- All API endpoints require JWT authentication (except login/refresh).
- Permission checks enforced on all protected routes.
- CORS strict mode blocks unauthorized cross-origin requests in production.
- Passwords hashed with Argon2 (memory-hard algorithm).
- Connection passwords encrypted with AES-256-GCM.

### Migration Guide

#### From v1.x to v2.0.0

1. **Environment Variables**: Update your configuration:
   ```bash
   # New required variables
   RBAC_DB_TYPE=sqlite|postgres
   JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
   RBAC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-char-key-for-aes>
   
   # For SQLite
   RBAC_SQLITE_PATH=./data/rbac.db
   
   # For PostgreSQL
   RBAC_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
   ```

2. **Initial Setup**: On first run, the system will:
   - Run database migrations automatically
   - Create default roles and permissions
   - Create a `admin` user (password from `RBAC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or `admin123`)

3. **User Migration**: Manually recreate users in the new RBAC system via Admin panel.

4. **Connection Setup**: Add your ClickHouse servers via Admin > Connections.

5. **Data Access**: Configure database/table permissions for non-admin users.
